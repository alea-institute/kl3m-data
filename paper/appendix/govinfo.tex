\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collection Methodology}

The GovInfo dataset is collected through the official GovInfo API provided by the U.S. Government Publishing Office. The collection methodology involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{API Integration} -- Using the official GovInfo API with authenticated access through an API key
    
    \item \textbf{Systematic Collection} -- Retrieving documents through several complementary approaches:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Collection-based retrieval targeting specific government collections
        \item Date-based retrieval covering documents from 1995 to the present
        \item Granule-level retrieval for collections with nested document structures
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Metadata Extraction} -- For each document:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Retrieving comprehensive metadata including title, date issued, collection code, and government author
        \item Processing multi-collection documents to ensure proper categorization
        \item Handling temporal relationships between documents
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Content Download} -- Implementing a sophisticated download process that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prioritizes text and PDF formats over ZIP archives when available
        \item Handles the on-demand generation of package content through API retry mechanisms
        \item Processes both package-level and granule-level content
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Duplicate Avoidance} -- Excluding collections already covered by separate specialized datasets (specifically CFR and FR)
\end{enumerate}

The collection process includes robust error handling for service interruptions, rate limiting compliance, and handling of dynamically generated content. The system implements intelligent caching to optimize API usage and ensure comprehensive coverage.

\subsection{Document Structure and Content Types}

The GovInfo dataset encompasses a diverse range of document types and formats reflecting the variety of government publications:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Document Organization}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Packages} -- Top-level container for related documents
        \item \textit{Granules} -- Subdivisions within packages (e.g., sections of a bill, chapters of a report)
        \item \textit{Collections} -- Thematic groupings of documents by government function or source
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Content Formats}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item PDF documents for formatted reading
        \item Text formats for plain text content

    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Content Description}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Title providing document summary
        \item Category classifying content type
        \item Government author attributing the creating entity
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This rich metadata enables complex searches and filtering capabilities, allowing targeted retrieval based on various criteria including date ranges, government branches, document types, and content categories.

\subsection{Legal Status}

The GovInfo dataset is primarily in the public domain under 17 U.S.C. ยง 105, which states that works created by the federal government are not subject to copyright protection. As specified in the dataset metadata: "In general, GovInfo documents fall under 17 U.S.C. 101 and 17 U.S.C. 105 and are therefore not subject to copyright protection. Any incorporated material not covered by these provisions will be clearly marked with a notice per 17 U.S.C. 403."

The legal status ensures that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Government-produced content is freely available for research and analysis
